# Append And Delete 

The goal of this problem is to determine if it's possible to convert one string to another by performing a series of append and delete operations within a given number of operations.

## Approach
1. Find the longest common prefix between `s` and `t`.
2. Calculate how many characters need to be removed from `s` and how many need to be appended to transform it into `t`.
3. Check if the total number of operations required is less than or equal to `k`.
4. If `k` is large enough to allow more operations than necessary, ensure it satisfies the condition of being an even number or greater than or equal to the combined length of both strings.
